Java Technology
	About
		- Java technology is both a programming language and a plat form
		- Java Programming Language {High level}
			: Simple
			: Object Oriented
			: Distributed
			: Arcitechture neutral
			: High Performance
			: Robust
			: Secure
			: Dynamic
			: Multi Threaded

		- Steps
			: Source code written with .java extension
			: Src code is then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler.
			: .class files contained bytecodes the machine language of Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
			: java laucher tool then runs applications with an instance of the JVM.
			: Cross-Platform
		- Java Platform
			: A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.
			: The java platform has two components
				- the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
				- the Java Application Programming Interface (API)
					:The API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provides many usefull capabilites.
					: It is grouped into libraries of related classes & interfaces; these libraries are known as packages.
					
		
	What can Java Do?
		- Development Tools
			: provides everything you'll need for compiling, monitoring, debugging and documenting your application.
		- API 
			: it spans everything from basic objects to networking & security to xml generation & database access.
		- User Interface Tools 
			: JavaFX, Swing & Java2D to create GUI
		- Integration Libraries 
			: libraries such as Java IDL API, JDBC API, JNDI API, Java RMI-IIOP technology enables database access and manipulation of remote objects

Hello World
	Demo
/* First Program */
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
    }
}

	Comments 
	//  s;jkldf 
	/* 
	 */	 
	class definition
		- class name { }
	main Method
		- public static void main(String[] args)
		- can write public & static in either order
		- arguement name can be anythin.
		- This array is mechanism to pass information to the application called Commandline Arguements. 
			eg. java HelloWorldApp arg1 arg2	
		- 
	println
		- prints the string

*******************************************************************************************************************************************
Question 1: When you compile a program written in the Java programming language, the compiler converts the human-readable source file into platform-independent code that a Java Virtual Machine can understand. What is this platform-independent code called?

Question 2: Which of the following is not a valid comment:

a. /** comment */
b. /* comment */
c. /* comment
d. // comment

Question 3: What is the first thing you should check if you see the following error at runtime:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
HelloWorldApp.java.
Question 4: What is the correct signature of the main method?

Question 5: When declaring the main method, which modifier must come first, public or static?

Question 6: What parameters does the main method define?
