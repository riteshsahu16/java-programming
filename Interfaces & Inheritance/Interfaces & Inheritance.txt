
Interfaces
-Contract
- In Java, Interfaces is a reference type that only contains constants, method signatures, default methods, static Methods, and nested types.
- Method bodies exists only for defualt methods and static methods.
- Interfaces cannot be instantiated - They can only be implemented by class or extended by other interfaces.

eg.

public interface Teacher
{
	void introduce();
	void teach();
}

public class John implements ITeacher
{
	// Implementation of all methods of ITeacher interface
	
}

The body of interface can contain abstract methods, default methods and static Methods.

An abstract method within an interface is followed a semicolon, but no braces {Does not contain any implementation}

Default methods are defined with the default modifier and static methods with static keywords

All abstract, default and static methods in an interfaces are implicitly public, so you can omit the public modifier

An Interface can contain constants declarations. All constants
